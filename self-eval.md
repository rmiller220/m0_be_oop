# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It was really freaking HARD! It is frustrating to see that the logic is right, but there are small errors in syntax. I feel I did what I could, then I reached out to teammates for help. We all seemed to be stuck at the same point. I also have learned to google better to help aid me in finding answers.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My worflow has been up and down. Sometimes I feel like I can get on a roll, or even push through obstacles. I think I need to take more short breaks. I do a great job of staying focused, but I think sometimes that can lead to burning my energy too quickly.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I think I need create a more comfortable environment for me to be in the same spot for long extended periods of time. The comfort would help relax me and possibly open my mind to other solutions
